🧠 How It Works
Students visit the site and choose to sign up as a Buyer or Seller.
Sellers can upload materials with image, price, and description.
Buyers can browse listings, filter them, and contact sellers (via planned chat).
Profiles and access are restricted based on the user's role.
Verified sellers are identified with a badge (via Aadhaar upload verification).
